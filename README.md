# Challenge Yourself 
## Creative Thinking Game

This Project is a interactive Front End Website, to play a dynamic thinking game. 
Each time the user clicks the "Generate Challenge" button, they are presented with 
mental models and problems, and prompted to write down the thoughts they come up 
with in response to the challenge. The user can then email themselves their responses.

### UX

The website is a intellectual exercise / game, and is for someone keen to practice their creative thinking 
and problem solving. It is also suitable for someone who wants to understand how mental models can be used
to better think about a problem.

#### User Stories:
I want to practice using mental models as a problem solving method, in order to use that skill in my work.
I want to have an intellectual challenge, as a source of entertainment.
I want to use different mental models to think about a specific problem I want to solve.

### Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Features
 - User can select the number of mental models or problems they would like to include.

- The user can add their own text for the problem to be used.

- The user can email their responses to themselves, as a method of keeping what they have come up with.

### Future Feature Ideas
- User being able to add multiple problems, and also add to the mental models.
- Timer function for added challenge
- Multiplayer option

### Technologies Used

- [html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), css, javascript
    - These were used for the basic layout, styling, and functioning of the website.

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
    - jQuery used for manipulating DOM eg. adding / changing elements and their contents.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - Bootstrap used for the layout of the site, and the card reveal function for adding problems.

- [emailjs](http://www.emailjs.com/)
    - emailJS used for sending the user the email with their challenge, without needing to add a backend.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - fontawesome used for icons

- [Coloors](https://coolors.co/)
    - Coloors used for the colour scheme.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

### Testing

- HTML Validator
- CSS Validator
- JS Lint
- 
or any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

### Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
