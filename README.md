# Challenge Yourself 
## Creative Thinking Game

This Project is a interactive Front End Website, to play a dynamic thinking game. 
Each time the user clicks the "Generate Challenge" button, they are presented with 
mental models and problems, and prompted to write down the thoughts they come up 
with in response to the challenge. The user can then email themselves their responses.

### UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

The website is a intellectual exercise / game, and is for someone keen to practice their creative thinking 
and problem solving. It is also suitable for someone who wants to understand how mental models can be used
to better think about a problem.

### User Stories:
I want to practice using mental models as a problem solving method, in order to use that skill in my work.
I want to have an intellectual challenge, as a source of entertainment.
I want to use different mental models to think about a specific problem I want to solve.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

testing:

html validator:

css validator:

js hint:


Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
